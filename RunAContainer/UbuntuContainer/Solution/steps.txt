Solution :

Step 1 : Pull "ubuntu" image tagged as latest from Docker Hub  and then create , run the container naming it as "MyUbuntu". 

docker run ~ docker pull + docker create + docker start

$ docker run -d --name MyUbuntu ubuntu:latest

Step 2: List all the running containers only ( our container won't be listed as it has stopped after running).

$ docker ps

Step 3: List all the containers in our workstation

$ docker ps -a
